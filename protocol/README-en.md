# Welcome to the wellbeing challenge!

This project is made by scientists from MIT, Harvard, the Child Mind Institute and Open Humans.

You will be prompted to:
1. Answer quick surveys about mental health.
2. Journal for just a few minutes. 
3. Choose at least one task per day especially chosen to improve wellbeing. 
4. Let us know how it went.  

You can participate without contributing data. If you choose to, it will be shared anonymously for academic purposes. We wish to:  
1. Help understand which activities improve wellbeing most.
2. Track changes in mental health through voice.
